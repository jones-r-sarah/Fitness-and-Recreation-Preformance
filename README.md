# Fitness-and-Recreation-Preformance

The university's Fitness and recreaction center I worked at needed some data to work off of for event and program planning so I decided to do it myself and label it as a class project so I can check 2 things off my list with one action.

Steps: 
1. I created the survey I was going to send out
2. I had all the answers go into a single spread sheet and had to then clean my data and make it uniform because for shor answer problems people would type in different ways or formats
3. Uploaded data to Tableau and RStudio to create charts and do basic analytics
4. wrote my final report
